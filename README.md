# THIS IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON [THUNDERSTORE](https://thunderstore.io/c/receiver-2/), AND IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU GRAB IT THERE

Also check out: [MagLoaderThing](https://github.com/CiarenceW/MagLoaderThing), this un-cuts a thing in the Compound that makes reloading big magazines like the ones for this gun lightning fast!  
And [this](https://github.com/CiarenceW/r2_CustomCompoundAmmoBoxes) as well, it adds ammo boxes for modded cartridges in the Compound, with possibilities of adding custom models for them too!
